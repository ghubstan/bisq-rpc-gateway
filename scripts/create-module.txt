go mod init bisq.grpc.proxy/main
go mod tidy

	# Without a dependency manager
	# For a Go project without a dependency management system, start by creating a go.mod file:

	go mod init golang.org/x/bisq-grpc-gateway

    # In this example, we set the module path to golang.org/x/bisq-grpc-gateway because that is its custom import path.
    # Users may import packages with this path, and we must be careful not to change it.

	go mod tidy

When using modules, the import path must match the canonical module path, so you may need to update import statements:
for example, you may need to change import "github.com/golang/lint" to import "golang.org/x/lint".
